# Evolutionary Computations Projects
This repository contains implementations of projects completed during evolutionary computation classes at Cracow University of Technology.

### Requirements:
- conda 24.11.3

### How to clone repo and recreate conda env:

- ```git clone https://github.com/pawel00wypych/Evolutionary-Computations-Binary-Chromosome.git```

- ```conda env create -f environment.yml```

- ```conda activate genetic-algorithm```

## Project 1 - Genetic algorithm
Implementation of a genetic algorithm to solve an optimization problem (maximization and minimization of a multivariable function). 
The implementation allows selecting any number of variables in the configuration (i.e., the ability to test the algorithm for functions with, 
for example, 5, 10, 20, or 27 variables).
